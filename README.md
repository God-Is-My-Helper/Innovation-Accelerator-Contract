## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Contract Structure

The smart contract implements a comprehensive project lifecycle:

```
Project Creation ‚Üí Milestone Addition ‚Üí Funding ‚Üí Mentor Assignment
        ‚Üì
Milestone Completion ‚Üí Fund Release ‚Üí Project Completion ‚Üí Reviews
```

### Data Maps

- **projects**: Core project information, funding status, and metadata
- **milestones**: Individual project milestones with funding amounts and deadlines
- **project-funding**: Funding contributions by individual backers
- **mentor-profiles**: Mentor statistics, earnings, and success rates
- **project-reviews**: Post-completion project ratings and reviews

## üìã Project Statuses

- **Active (1)**: Project accepting funding and milestones
- **Completed (2)**: All milestones completed successfully
- **Cancelled (3)**: Project cancelled by admin
- **Funded (4)**: Funding goal reached, ready for milestone execution

## üéØ Milestone Statuses

- **Pending (1)**: Milestone awaiting completion
- **Completed (2)**: Milestone successfully completed
- **Failed (3)**: Milestone deadline passed without completion
